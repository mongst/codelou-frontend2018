# codelou-frontend2018
Capstone Project for Sept 2018 Front End Class.

Frontend2018 is a basic website that contains HTML CSS and JavaScript.

## How to view the project:
1. Download/Save using green download button on github website.

2. Unzip file / open folder and double click on "index.html" to open in browser.
  * Note: if you have JavaScript disabled you will not see JS elements on the page.


## Description of project:

### Index.HTML
The project I built is a basic article page.  It opens with two JavaScript alerts greeting you and then welcoming you to the page.

At the top of the page is the "Hide/Show" Button that will move the project description on or off the page with a "slide" effect.

The next section is the title bar, followed by simple navigation menu that takes you to one of the 3 articles.

Each article has a has an image, text and link back to the navigation menu after the article.

The footer section has some text and a placeholder email link.

### Things I would do differently with more time

The whole page is lackluster and with more time I would have flushed out more of the site:

1. Navigation menu.
  * Buttons & shadow
  * Different or themed text stylesheet

2. More JavaScript
  * Lightbox for article images.
  * Something fun to make page more interactive.


## What I've Learned:

Coding takes time - its not copy paste - its not always fast and easy.  I've used some basic HTML in the past but this course was my first encounter with CSS and JavaScript.  It was fun to take my first steps into the world of coding.
